# JamboWaker
Got bored one day, decided to make a program that automatically opens my PC (Jambo, hence the name) whenever I get home from university simply by just checking if phone is has connected to the WiFi network and sending a WoL Magic Packet. 
Sends a message though a discord bot notifying the user of the wakeup.
Pretty simple code. Currently requires seperate device (Using a Linux server) to run the code continuously. Might remake in Flutter to run directly on phone in background one day.
