Got bored one day, decided to make a program that automatically opens my PC (Jambo, hence the name) whenever I get home from university simply by just checking if phone is has connected to the WiFi network. 

Pretty simple code. Currently requires seperate device (using a linux server) to run the code continuously. Might remake in Flutter to run directly on phone in background one day.
